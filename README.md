# Advent of Code

My take on <https://adventofcode.com/>.

## Personal rule

To spice things up a bit, I set the following rule for myself: every new
solution must be written in either:

 * A language that I havenâ€™t used before in this repository.
 * A language in the bottom 33% used in this repository, by lines of code.

Languages used as of 2024 day 1, as computed by `languages.sh`:
