# Advent of Code

My take on <https://adventofcode.com/>.

## Personal rule

To spice things up a bit, I set the following rule for myself: every new
solution must be written in either:

 * A language that I havenâ€™t used before in this repository.
 * A language in the bottom 50% used in this repository, by lines of code.

Some languages that I still want to try:

 * Clojure
 * D
 * F#
 * Guile, Racket
 * Hoon
 * Nim
 * OCaml
 * Prolog
 * Zig
