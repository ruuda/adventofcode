# Advent of Code

My take on <https://adventofcode.com/>.

## Personal rule

In 2023 and 2024 I used the following personal rule. To spice things up a bit,
every new solution must be written in either:

 * A language that I haven’t used before in this repository.
 * A language in the bottom 33% used in this repository, by lines of code.

As of 2025, I want to get a bit more hands-on experience with Zig, so maybe this
year I'll limit myself to Zig, maybe with some RCL and Pony.

Languages used as of 2024 day 15, as computed by `languages.sh`:
