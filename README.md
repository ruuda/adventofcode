# Advent of Code

My take on <https://adventofcode.com/>.

## Personal rule

To spice things up a bit, I set the following rule for myself: every new
solution must be written in either:

 * A language that I havenâ€™t used before in this repository.
 * A language in the bottom 50% used in this repository, by lines of code.

Some languages that I still want to try:

 * [ ] Clojure
 * [ ] D
 * [ ] F#
 * [ ] Guile, Racket
 * [ ] Hoon
 * [ ] Nim
 * [ ] OCaml
 * [ ] Prolog
 * [x] Zig
